# Python-Barcode-Module-
Barcode reading function in python (V1)

# Why this module?
I recently used Python to work on a billing system. I intended to incorporate a barcode function into the code in the application's final stages. I attempted to create my own as everyone else does, but it was unsuccessful. I then turned to Google to get a better answer. Unfortunately, I couldn't discover much information about this subject. So, I began my own investigation into barcode technologies. After examining that, I then developed this function. As a software engineering undergrad, I knew very little about barcode readers and systems. My code finally functioned, and it was quite straightforward and complete. I hope that this will be useful for Python programmers and explorers who are interested in such stuff :)
